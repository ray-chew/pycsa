This page documents the codebase for the Constrained Spectral Approximation Method (CSA). CSA is a physically sound and robust method for approximating the spectrum of subgrid-scale orography. It operates under the following constraints:

* Utilises a limited number of spectral modes (no more than 100)
* Significantly reduces the complexity of physical terrain by over 500 times
* Maintains the integrity of physical information to a large extent
* Compatible with unstructured geodesic grids
* Inherently scale-aware

This method is primarily used to represent terrain for weather forecasting purposes, but it also shows promise for broader data analysis applications.
